<p>
World of Warcraft was developed by Blizzard Entertainment and released in 2004.
The development team created a massive online world that could support millions of players.
</p>

<p>
The game required years of design, programming, art development, and testing.
Developers continuously update the game with expansions and patches.
</p>

<p>
For this website project, I focused on organizing content clearly
and ensuring that all pages are connected through navigation.
I expanded the site for Lab W07 by adding fan content and Q&A pages
while keeping all previous pages intact.
</p>

<p>
One challenge I faced was maintaining consistent navigation across all pages.
However, by updating each file carefully, I ensured all links work properly.
